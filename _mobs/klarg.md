**His left arm and the LHS of his face are animated dead flesh which is spreading**

Klarg is the leader of the goblin wargang.  He has been afflicted by the zombie disease and the goblins are mored scared of him than ever due to his random violent rages that result in goblins and humans alike being savagely beaten to death (eventually with fists and tearing chunks of flesh out with his mouth).

* Draenog, the bugbear, was sent by King Grol to check up on him
* He resents Draenog
* He is succumbing to the zombie sickness
