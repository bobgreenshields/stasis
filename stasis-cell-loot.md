This cell is full of a sticky mass of white oval eggs (30-40cm long).  At least forty of them covering the floor of the cell.  Central to the other eggs is a larger one (twice as big).  There is movement within the leathery white skin of this one.

On picking up the egg for the first time the pc will experience multiple, rapid shocking visions from an alien perspective.  Make a DC10 Wis sv. or take 1d4 psychic damage and be stunned for one round.
