A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from the mechanism.  Each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The gun with the flickering crystals only has a 4-6 on a d6 chance of firing.  Guns will choose different targets if more than one is presented.  Each mechanism has 3 crystals mounted behind the barrel.  The semi operative one has one dull lifeless crystal and the other two flicker wildly.  If the party has an energised crystal it is simple to remove the dull one and replace it bringing the gun back to full operation.
