Each mechanism has 2 crystals mounted behind the barrel.  The northern gun has fully charged crystals and works perfectly.  The southern one has one dull lifeless crystal and the other flickers wildly.  If the party has an energised crystal it is simple to remove the dull one and replace it bringing the gun back to full operation. Otherwise it twitches when trying to track targets and only fires half of the time.

The guns will not track or fire on a target outside of the frontal arc and will be deactivated if the power crystals are removed from their slots.  Reinserting the crystals will reactivate the guns.

### Effect ###
A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from the mechanism.  Each creature in the line is attacked.

* 3d6 lightning damage DC 11 Dex save
* half damage on save
* the gun with the flickering crystals only has a 4-6 on a d6 chance of firing.
* guns will choose different targets if more than one is presented.

### Power crystals ###
Energised power crystals will explode if hit with Radiant damage.  They explode in a 20 ft radius doing 5d6 radiant damage to anyone in the area. If checked using [**Int (Arcana) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) DC 10 this will become apparent.
