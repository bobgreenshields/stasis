As the cave opens out there the floor drops away precipitously (about 20 ft).  Although sheer and almost vertical there are good holds.  If taken slowly it is a DC 8 [Athletics check]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}).  However when the first climbers descend 2 Young Kruthik will come out of the small tunnel, scamper easily across the rock face and attack the climbers.  The climbers have a choice when engaging the Kruthik.  Focus on holding on (-2 to AC and Attack rolls) or focus on fighting (make a DC 15 Athletics check each round or fall).  After 2 rounds an Adult Kruthik will appear in the opening (C) and begin to fire spikes at the pcs.

[**Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %})
* DC 16 [active search] there is a small tunnel part way down the sheer drop (B)
