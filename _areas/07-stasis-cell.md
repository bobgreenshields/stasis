From the third cell onwards roll a d4 to see which cell holds the eggs.

In the centre of the room is a smooth stone sarcophagus.  Six power crystals sit in slots at one end 1d4 still have some power.  The stone lid has cracked and can be moved aside to reveal a skeleton.  All the skin and flesh has succumbed to the years but rusting armour and a weapon can be seen within.

Searching for a round will reveal some loot.
