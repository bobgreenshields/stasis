Each cell is the same holding a stasis chamber.

On entry consult [cell loot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link stasis-cell-loot.md %}) to check the details of this paricular cell.

In the centre of the room is a smooth stone sarcophagus.  Six power crystals sit in slots at one end 1d4 still have some power.  The stone lid has cracked and can be moved aside to reveal a skeleton.  All the skin and flesh has succumbed to the years but rusting armour and a weapon can be seen within.

Searching for a round will reveal some loot.
