The Kruthik (2A + Y) will be seen immediately.  One of the hatchlings is carrying away some bones in it's jaws.  The other a strange object.  As soon as the Kruthik spot the pcs they start madly clicking and then the adult one begins a high pitch screeching (a la Xenomorph) this is then picked up by the young.  A round later it can be heard from the south end of corridor 4.  Roll the Doom Timer d4.
