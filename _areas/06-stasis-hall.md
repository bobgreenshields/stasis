#### [Spawning](#spawing) ####
#### [Sentry guns](#sentry-guns) ####

The Kruthik (2A + Y) will be seen immediately.  One of the hatchlings is carry away some bones in it's jaws.  The other a strange object.  As soon as the Kruthik spot the pcs they start madly clicking and then the adult one begins a high pitch screeching (a la Xenomorph) this is then picked up by the young.  A round later it can be heard being picked up from the south end of corridor 4.  Roll the Doom Timer d4.

[**Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %})
* DC 18 spot the ceiling tunnel
* DC 10 one of the hatchlings is carrying a broken egg sack

### Spawning ###

Once the alarm has been raised roll a d4 Doom Timer.  Once this has expired roll the dice shown below each round

| Location | Roll | Notes |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| Corridor | 2d6 | Area 4 |
| Tunnel E | 1d6 | Comes in at walkway level |
| Tunnel F | 1d10 | Comes in at ceiling |

For each 1 on the dice roll on the spawn table.  The indicated mob will arrive at the location in question at the start of the round and act at the end of the initiative order.

| Roll | Normal | Tunnel F |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 1 | 2Y | 1Y |
| 2 | 2: | 1Y |
| 3 | 1A | 2Y |
| 4 | 1A 1Y | 2Y |
| 5 | 1A 2Y | 2Y |
| 6 | 2A | 3Y |

### Sentry Guns ###

If sentry guns and possibly the construct are placed in the long corridor the Kruthik spawning from this location will already be injured when they arrive.  If there are two guns and more than one Kruthik then two Kruthik will be injured.  The partially active sentry gun can be upgraded to fully active by replacing the spent power crystals with energised ones.

| In corridor | Effect |
|:--------|:--------|
| Active sentry gun | 2d6 damage |
| Partially active sentry gun | 1d6 damage |
| Construct | roll twice on best gun |
