* DC 15 the four unusual stones embedded in the walls
* DC 19 the glowing crystals at the back of the mechanisms, the crystals at the back of one mech. are flickering

### Lightning guns ###

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from the mechanism.  Each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The gun with the flickering crystals only has a 4-6 on a d6 chance of firing.  Guns will choose different targets if more than one is presented.  Each mechanism has 3 crystals mounted behind the barrel.  The semi operative one has one dull lifeless crystal and the other two flicker wildly.  If the party has an energised crystal it is simple to remove the dull one and replace it bringing the gun back to full operation.

### Construct ###

The construct has a move of 30 ft. and is slightly larger than a human.  It will attempt to close with an interloper and then grapple it.  It has an Athletics +5
