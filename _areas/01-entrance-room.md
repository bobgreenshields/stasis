A strong musty smell pervades the chamber.  The walls are damp and slippery.  Water trickles out of a large opening on the north wall, pools on the floor and runs down into a drain.  A heavy grille lies in the pool.  It obviously fits the opening in the wall.

* DC 14 The grille was pushed out from the other side.
* DC 16 The grille shows recent scratches on the other side.
