A strong musty smell pervades the chamber.  The walls are damp and slippery.  Water trickles out of a large opening on the north wall, pools on the floor and runs down into a drain.  A heavy grille lies in the pool.  This room has been used a haven and shelter for different generations when the village was under attack.
