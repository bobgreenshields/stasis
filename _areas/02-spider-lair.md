The walls, floor and ceiling of this cave are covered in a mesh of webs.  Curtains of thick heavy webs drape the walls obscuring the exact shape of the cave

Even with the webs it's clear a tunnel exits the opposite side of the cave.

[**Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %})
* **DC 22** at C & D web covered orbs.
* **DC 20** a giant spider is hidden on the ceiling above the entrance.
* **DC 18** at E darker man sized shadowy regions.
* **DC 18** at A & B web covered orbs.
* **DC 13** some of the strands are much thicker (finger thickness)  than the ones encountered in the tunnel leading to this cave.

On the round after the party enter the cave the giant spider on the roof will use it's first action (surprise round if not spotted) to fire a web to cover the entrance behind the party.

Once the web action recharges it will move to the ceiling and target a party member at random.
