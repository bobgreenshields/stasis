The tunnel is obviously natural.  A 5ft.

The end of the tunnel opens out into a cave with a 30ft. high roof.  There is an 8ft. high flowstone step with water trickling down it's length.  It is not vertical and can be readily climbed however an [Athletics check]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %}) may be needed if anyone tries to do anything other than careful climbing.

If someone starts climbing the step and looks over the edge into 14 the hatchling will attack immediately but if injured will flee up the next step to area 15.

[**Wis (Perception) check**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link party.md %})
* DC 16 Something is moving in the water above the step, occasional gentle sharp splashes can be heard
