There's another energised power crystal in this room somewhere.

There's a raised central dias with a fallen statue atop it.  The statue is decorated with sunken jewels on the pendant about its neck and the hilt of the sword.  They can be prised out with a dagger in a few rounds.  They are worth several hundred GP.

However Kruthik will begin to issue from the tunnels if the party stay too long or make too much noise.
