Near to the middle of the abandoned village are the ruins of a larger building.  Although tumbled down the walls are thicker than any of the others and it's obvious that this was a fortified building.  In one of the back rooms of the building are the hinges and metal straps from a pair of trapdoors descending into the ground.
