Near to the middle of the abandoned village are the ruins of a larger building.  Although tumbled down the walls are thicker than any of the others and it's obvious that this was a fortified homestead.  In one of the back rooms a flight of steps lead down below ground.  Rusted hinges and metal straps are all the remain of the trapdoors that used to cover the stairs.
