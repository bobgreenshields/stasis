### DEFINITIONS ###
* Grappling is a "special melee attack".
* To grapple a target, you must "use the Attack action" to then make your special melee attack (the grapple).
  * From an RAW perspective, the "Multiattack" ability of monsters cannot enable multiple grapples because it is its own action type.
  * If you have multiple attacks for the Attack action, you can replace as many of them as you want with grapple checks.
  * You cannot replace bonus action attacks (e.g. from the Monk or a Barbarian's Frenzy) with grapples.
* A grapple check is an Ability check contested by a target's ability check. It is NOT an attack roll!
* Your grapple target "must be no more than one size larger than you". It must also be within your reach.
* You need at least one free hand to initiate a grapple.
* If you or your target are subject to any involuntary movement, the grapple ends immediately.
* Unlike in previous D&D editions, there is no penalty for grappling multiple targets. You can grapple as many targets as you have hands (typically two).


### INITIATING A GRAPPLE ###
* Start by using your Attack action to make a grapple check. If you have "multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them."
* Make a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check, as contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) OR Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. They get to choose what they contest with.
* If you fail the ability check contest, nothing happens. There are no consequences for you or your target for failing a grapple check.
  * If you have multiple attacks using the Attack action, commonly from the Extra Attack class feature, you can replace another one with another grapple check.
* If you succeed at an ability check contest, the target is instantly subjected to the [grappled condition.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _rules/conditions.md %}#grappled)
  * You do not move into the target's square: both of you stay right where you were when you started the grapple.

### BEING IN A GRAPPLE ###
* While grappled, the grappled creature has the [grappled condition.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _rules/conditions.md %}#grappled)
* The grappler himself does NOT have the grappled condition.
* As a result of the grappled condition, the target's movement speed drops to 0. It also "can't benefit from any bonus to its speed" during that time.
* "A grappled creature can use its action to escape". This will require them to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as contested by your own Strength (Athletics) check.
  * If they succeed, they are immediately free of the grapple, but they have used their action.
  * If they fail, they are still grappled and have still used their action.
* If a grappled creature does not try to escape, you automatically maintain the grapple from turn to turn.
* Because escaping isn't very action-efficient, some opponents might try to shove you instead (remember that shove replaces Extra Attacks). This forced movement would also break the grapple. Indeed, any involuntary movement on either of your parts would break it.
* A grappled creature can also grapple the grappler himself! This will set both grapplers' speeds at 0 and neither will be able to move.


When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a Special melee Attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this Attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an Attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the Grappled condition (see Conditions ). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

Escaping a Grapple: A Grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

Moving a Grappled Creature: When you move, you can drag or carry the Grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

This [explanation](https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/melee-ranged-attacks-allowed-while-grappling-in-5e.829962/) is very helpful to understanding what is meant.

The advantage of Grappling is battlefield control. They can’t move, but you can (and you can drag or carry your victim along). Smart combatants who grapple, drag, shove, or drop, their victim into environmental hazards whenever possible or they can use them to block a doorway and limit tactical choices, etc. Being Grappled is often mildly inconvenient. It can also be a death sentence if there is a hazard like lava around.

Grappling is something humanoids do with only one hand/arm. Grappling is not wrestling. It’s grabbing some part of the victim, an arm, or a leg, or part of their clothing, the edge of a shield or equipment, like a sword sheath or backpack strap. They can’t get away (without taking an action to making an effort), but you have no control over their ability to attack. You are in no way “inside their reach.” But you also maintain your ability to defend yourself.

If you are trying to hold onto an enemy with just 1 hand, you aren’t going to be disabling all their limbs. Since every grapple is not described exactly what part of the victim is grappled, perfectly reasonable that they can still hit you with any weapon. Grabbing someone’s leg, or belt, or backpack doesn’t stop them from shooting you with a bow. It just makes it a bit harder, which is already represented. It won’t do a thing if they are trying to hit you with a one handed weapon, heavy or light.

Grappled and Restrained are closer to what you think of as “grappling” but they never imply total control or domination. It already mechanically represents the inability to move ones arms freely with disadvantage. If they miss, you can think of that as the grappler successfully held their arms. If they hit, they overcame the grapple enough to attack, but not enough to escape. Prone and Grappled works almost as well.

If you apply one rule to be more realistic, but not every possible rule, you will increase how powerful grapple is. If grappling is “moving in” on someone with a sword, why don’t they get an attack of opportunity on the idiot trying to impale themselves? If you try to fully realized grappling and all the implications of trying to grapple in fights involving lots of people with melee weapons, you might as well go full 3e and have multiple pages of rules for how grappling works. It’s your game, if you and your players enjoy that, go nuts.

Conditions where someone has no ability to act (tied up completely, every limb grappled by multiple enemies, etc) don't exist in the rules. If you want such things to happen, the DM just has to narrate those kinds of events and decide what can and cannot be done.

Obviously humanoid grappling can be significantly different from the kind of grappling that various monster of various body shapes can do. Grappled and Restrained are two conditions that abstractly cover a wide range of situations. Because trying to cover every possible kind of monster grapple with its own rule would be insane. What if your enemy has more arms than you? If you want to create special rules, for every special type of grapple and restrain, nobody is stopping you. But in general it's not worth slowing down game play to bother doing that.

You also want look out for unintended consequences. When you get to higher levels, monsters start swallowing characters. Which results in the Grappled and Restrained condition, inside the digestive system. Escaping from the inside can usually only be done by doing substantial damage during a single round of combat. Depending on your group, and their weapon options, you might accidentally make it impossible for them to escape being swallowed.
